# Data Analyst Scrapping Project 

This Repository will hold all of the code and queries from the Portfolio Projects we create.

It will show all the code as well as the results after Scrapping data from Amazon.

In this case, as someone who love coffee and has affected by pandemic, I have to step up my game in the coffee related. I have bought some equipments to brew coffee at home. One of the most important factor is the grind size, it could be super fine to coarse. There are a few option for grinders but the price is expensive. There are a few famous manual grinders such as Comandante and Orphan Espresso. Living under the shadow of those fancy grinders, TImemore, break the game with their Chestnut C2 grinders. As an upgraded version of Chestnut G1- Award winning of reddot in 2017, it keeps the sleek design and material but the price is suprisingly low compare to the other grinders. 

# Why Timemore? 
It makes me feel of Xiaomi who has the philosophy "budget yet quality". Their products have distinctive look as well as the excellent value of money. 
The burr is made of Stainless steel with 38mm stell burr
Body is aluminum
Weight: 465 gram 
It is light weight grinder compare to other grinders. 
Timemore C2 has more setting to alternate the different grind size

This project will extract the up to date price for the Timemore C2 as well as creating the notification when the price dropped so that I can get it in the future. 

The data has been saved into the csv file with Title, Price, Rating and the time data was collected. 

Summary of result: the Timemore C2 currently dropped to Â£65 which is pretty low compare to their competitiors such as 1Zpresso. The review is 4.8/5 which is excellent review.
