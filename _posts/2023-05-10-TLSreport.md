Introducing the ultimate guild management companion: a dynamic weekly update dashboard for Maple Story M. Stay on top of activities, set goals, and access invaluable insights to foster motivation and create a welcoming guild atmosphere.

The dashboard showcase is available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRfE01WV3VvT1nJbXA9RHHUCI62DCtKBRM0lCH7YLpGpVr6eERto3_x7OKrPgOvhhwZCxsxDXWYfR4B/pubhtml?gid=1968448146&single=true).

## Introduction

Maple Story M has been established in 2017, but it was first published in 2003 as an online MMORPG (massively multiplayer online role-playing game) by Nexon company. It is an attractive game that is free to play, 2D, with "cute animation characters". It doesn't really have a PvP function but only defeats or hunts monsters to develop characters' skills. With an amazing story for each character and the game's main plot, players can enjoy the game in multiple ways, including chatting and trading. 

In this matter. I could call the selling point for the game about ability to socialise. The game successfully creates a social environment where players can enjoy fighting concepts, communicate with other players, and buy fashion that makes them look good. The game has satisfied players' needs. If I could use the business term to analyze it, I would demonstrate it in Maslow's model: 

- Belongingness: Connect with others, join communities, and form friendships.
- Esteem: Gain recognition, achieve goals, and boost self-confidence.
- Socialization: Chat, cooperate, and celebrate with fellow players.
- Safety: Enjoy a secure and controlled virtual environment.
- Self-Actualization: Express creativity, pursue personal growth, and fulfil achievements.
- Cognitive and Aesthetic: Engage in intellectually stimulating quests and appreciate visually appealing graphics.

TheLostSocks- however, being #4 in the server demonstrates the competitive strength. However, they have a balanced playstyle which is unique for the server, allowing members can have a more relaxed, chill atmosphere while still can archive higher competitive content in the game. 

## TheLostSocks SWOT analysis: 

I was mentioning Maslow's model, so here is the SWOT analysis of this guild. I drafted it so I could find something useful for the dashboard

Now I know our guild's strengths and weaknesses. I figure out that it is quite hard to keep strong players for better content without making them burn out so collaborating with another guild should be considered for higher content. This solution affects them to be competitive while not feeling an obligation to be strong if they have to move to a stronger guild for content. 

However, the new players would feel lost if there are no mentors or motivation for them to play so the social activity and guidance as well as the checkup for progression would motivate them for sustainable growth.
