## Introduction

Maple Story M has been established in 2017, but it was first published in 2003 as an online MMORPG (massively multiplayer online role-playing game) by Nexon company. It is an attractive game that is free to play, 2D, "cute animation characters". It doesnt really have PvP function but only defeating or hunting monsters to develop characters's skills. With amazing story for each character as well as the main plot for the game, players can enjoy the game in multiple ways, including chatting and trading. 

In this matter. I could call the selling point for the game is about ability to social. The game has successful creating the social environment where players can enjoy fighting concept, communicating with other players, buying fashion that make them look good. The game has satisfied players needs. IF I could use the business term to analyze it, I would demostrate it in Maslow model: 

- Belongingness: Connect with others, join communities, and form friendships.

- Esteem: Gain recognition, achieve goals, and boost self-confidence.

- Socialization: Chat, cooperate, and celebrate with fellow players.

- Safety: Enjoy a secure and controlled virtual environment.

- Self-Actualization: Express creativity, pursue personal growth, and fulfill achievements.

- Cognitive and Aesthetic: Engage in intellectually stimulating quests and appreciate visually appealing graphics.
